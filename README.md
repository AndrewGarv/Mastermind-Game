# Mastermind-Game
A text simulation of the Mastermind game. One of my first projects made in 2011

# What is this?
This simulates a Mastermind game using text. Guess against the computer and choose a difficulty level. This was done entirely in Java. It is one of my first semi large projects and to this day it is still something that works 
consistently well. Were I to modify it today I would definitely add graphical elements to it
